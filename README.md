# CNN_CatDog
This Cat or Dog Classifier utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to carry out binary image classification tasks. Engineered by Barry Rerecich, the architecture incorporates multiple convolutional layers, each followed by max-pooling layers, and concludes with a fully connected dense layer activated by a sigmoid function for binary outcomes. The model was trained on a Kaggle dataset featuring labeled images of cats and dogs, and it employs binary cross-entropy as the loss function. The project stands as a comprehensive study on the applicability and efficacy of CNNs in high-precision image classification.
